# MOZ

Moz is a school project I completed within one week. In this project, I aimed to design a social media application. There is no Firebase Authentication integrated, so the login credentials (username and password) can be found directly in the code. By using these credentials, you can access the application's main page.

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
